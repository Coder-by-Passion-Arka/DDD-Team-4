## This is a README file of Arkapravo Das through which I give a overview of my Daily Work

## Day 3 ( 13/06/2025 ):
    -- Fully Mobile Responsive Design. 
    -- Improved Color Scheme.
    -- Implemented full analytics page with Chart.js on dummy data.
    -- Made simple backend which will be improved in the future.

## Day 2 ( 12/06/2025 ):
    -- Successfully integrated Dark Mode. 
    -- Made the design mobile responsive.
    -- Added pages (earlier filled with dummy data), with real data.
    -- Made the Designing more streamlined and fluid

## Day 1 ( 11/06/2025 ):

    -- Today we made our very own Dashboard using React & Tailwind. Our aim make a starting point for adding more features into this project as the days pass by.

    -- Our Dashboard consisted of Navigation Side-Bar, Progress Tracking Plots, Daily Streak Counters, Tasks and much more. For now we have used dummy data but later down the line we will make a dedicated Backend for Data retrieval.

    -- Implemented the basic logical code snippet for User authentication using Json Web Token (althogh it is not compete yet)

    -- Implemented a simple ChatBot which can later be trained to help student with learning

## Features

### Dashboard

    - **Statistics Cards**: Track key metrics including submissions, in-progress assignments, evaluations, and completed tasks
    - **Progress Visualization**: Interactive charts displaying daily submission and evaluation activities
    - **Streak Counter**: Gamified feature to encourage consistent participation
    - **Recent Assignments**: Organized view of upcoming and past assignments with status indicators

### Navigation

    - **Responsive Sidebar**: Intuitive navigation with clear iconography
    - **Mobile Responsive Design**: Context-aware path display for mobile users (in development)

### Pages (All the Pages are not yet complete)

    - Dashboard

    - Evaluations
    - Analytics
    - Achievements
    - Profile
    - Settings
    - AI Chatbot Assistant

### UI/UX

    - **Modern Design**: Clean interface with card-based components
    - **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices (in progress)
    - **Dark/Light Mode**: Support for user preference (in progress)

### Authentication

    - Basic JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication implementation (in development)

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

    - **React**: Component-based UI library
    - **TypeScript**: Type-safe code
    - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
    - **Lucide Icons**: Lightweight icon library

## Current Status

This project is in active development. Currently, the application uses dummy data for demonstration purposes. Future iterations will include:

    - Complete user authentication and authorization
    - Backend integration for data persistence
    - Enhanced analytics features
    - Expanded evaluation tools

## Next Steps

    - Finalize JWT authentication implementation
    - Develop backend API for data retrieval
    - Implement real-time notifications
    - Add collaborative evaluation features
